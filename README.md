```lrc
[00:11.02] I know it's a little old-fashioned
[00:15.37] Holding hands, now start your romancin'
[00:20.14] Show me all your flaws
[00:23.05] Show me your bear claws
[00:25.55] Go rip your heart out tonight
[00:30.50] You don't have to be cool to make me shiver
[00:35.14] Look in my eyes, can I make this any clearer?
[00:39.41] Just a late-night girl, calling through a phone
[00:44.74] She never really loved you so just leave her alone
[00:49.66] Your mama says it's over when you come through the door
[00:54.30] Saying "That's enough of you now, won't you shut your mouth?"
[00:59.90] Ay! Oh!
[01:02.46] I'll never let you go
[01:05.45] Ay! Oh!
[01:07.37] I'll never let you go
[01:10.11] You say goodbye as if you're leaving on a plane
[01:14.70] You've seen the clouds and how the shapes are so strange
[01:19.29] And not the boy in the backseat, staying in the backseat
[01:22.15] Tryin' to make sense of it all
[01:24.19] He's saying, "We were such a good thing, we were such a good thing
[01:26.98] How could you let this fall?"
[01:29.85] Take all my money and meet me on the sidewalk
[01:34.81] If you don't show then I'll know
[01:38.85] Just a late-night girl, calling through a phone
[01:44.02] She never really loved you so just leave her alone
[01:49.07] Your mama says it's over when you come through the door
[01:53.65] Saying "That's enough of you now won't you shut your mouth?"
[01:59.78] Ay! Oh!
[02:01.78] I'll never let you go
[02:04.89] Ay! Oh!
[02:06.78] I'll never let you go
[02:17.28] 
[02:29.06] Show me all your flaws, show me your bear claws
[02:34.18] Go rip your heart out tonight
[02:37.50] You were just a late-night girl, calling through a phone
[02:43.50] She never really loved you so just leave her alone
[02:48.43] Your mama says it's over when you come through the door
[02:53.11] Saying "That's enough of you now won't you shut your mouth?"
[02:58.29] "That's enough of you, kid, now you're going South, love"
[03:04.19] Ay! Oh!
[03:06.34] I'll never let you go
[03:09.15] Ay! Oh!
[03:11.10] I'll never let you go
[03:13.52] Ay! Oh! (Show me all your flaws)
[03:16.33] I'll never let you go
[03:18.46] Ay! Oh! (Show me all your flaws)
[03:20.97] I'll never let you go
